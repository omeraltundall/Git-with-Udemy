It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.

git init is for initialize the git.
git status looking for changes that not commited.
git commit -m "Your commit message" is commit the changes.
git log looking to commits.
git diff fileName is check the diff between now and commited 
git checkout fileName is reverse the changes till the commited way

git remote add origin "Link from github" is open a remote repository named origin


!!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!
Before git push -u origin main u should change main branch from master to main with git branch -M main

git push -u origin main is push the last commit in the main branch inside remote repository labeled origin.
